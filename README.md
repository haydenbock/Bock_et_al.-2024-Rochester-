# Bock_et_al.-2024-Rochester-
Data for Bock et al. 2024 Eco Letters


All analyses were conducted in the 'ManuscriptAnalysis4.0.R' file. The script is organized by our study questions/hypotheses;
  Q1 - understanding how urbanization influences soil animal community composition
  Q2 - understanding the most important drivers of community composition
  Q3 - testing the urban homogenization hypothesis and determining stochastic/deterministic forces of urbanization


All data for the analyses are found in the '/data' folder. Within the folder, the 'NMDS_Data.csv' file represents the most complete data file. Other files are subsetted or are other permutations of that original dataset. File paths within each analysis are routed to the proper files for easy reference.
